                <h1>Art and Architecture</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>Nepal's art and architecture are deeply intertwined with its rich cultural heritage and historical significance. From ancient times to the present day, the country has been a hub of artistic expression and architectural marvels that reflect its diverse traditions and spiritual beliefs.</p>
                    <p>One of the most striking aspects of Nepali art is its intricate woodcarvings, which adorn temples, palaces, and traditional buildings throughout the country. These woodcarvings, often depicting deities, mythical creatures, and intricate patterns, showcase the exceptional skill and craftsmanship of Nepali artisans.</p>
                    <p>Apart from woodcarving, even stone sculptures, metal art, and painting are some of the artistic practices which have a great significance in Nepal. The Kathmandu Valley, the prime example, is a wondrous storehouse of artistic treasures, granted UNESCO World Heritage status to protect the historical sites such as Bhaktapur Durbar Square, Patan Durbar Square, and Swayambhunath Stupa (the Monkey Temple) which is five hundred years old of art and architecture.</p>
                    <p>The architecture of Nepal is well known for its ability to combine elements of Hindu and Buddhist culture, leading to the construction of most important buildings like temples, pagodas, stupas and palaces. Among others, the rich craftsmanship of the Newar community is a well-known positive trait of Newari architecture.</p>
                    <p>Iconic architecture in Nepal is another evident example, namely the Kathmandu Durbar Square, a complex of palaces, temples and courtyards showing a unique cultural and patrimonial background of the region. The delicate circles that are the buildings' windows, the artistic workshops, and the slate-covered roofs portray the artistic nature of their Nepalese authors and masons.</p>
