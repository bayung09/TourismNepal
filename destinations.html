                <img class="des-img"  src="IMAGES/Destinations/kathmandu.jpg" alt="kathmandu">
                <p>Nepal's largest city, Kathmandu, serves as both the political and cultural hub of the nation. In Kathmandu, cutting-edge technical advancements coexist with age-old customs. The visitor is mesmerised by the magnificence of the past, though, and may find themselves staring at stupas that are meant to inspire spirituality, a bronze sculpture from the 18th century, or an intricately carved wooden window frame. Like any major city, Kathmandu has grown rapidly in the past ten years, but its residents are still incredibly amiable despite the cacophony of modern metropolitan life. With its long-standing customs still in place, Kathmandu is endowed with a Living Goddess and is frequently the scene of countless ceremonial processions and festivals that draw hordes of pilgrims hoping to receive blessings from the goddess. These mythical religious celebrations are quite a sight, featuring masked dancers frequently taken over by the spirits of the gods and chariot processions.
